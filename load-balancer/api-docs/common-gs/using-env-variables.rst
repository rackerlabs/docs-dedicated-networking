..  note::
		The environment variables created with the ``export`` command are
		valid only for the current terminal session. If you start a new session, run the
		export commands again.

		To reuse the variables across sessions, update the configuration file for your shell
		environment to include the export statements. For details
		about using and managing environment variables on different systems, see the
		`environment variables wiki`_.
