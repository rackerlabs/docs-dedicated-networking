Rackspace |product name| API |contract version|
===============================================

*Last updated:* |today|

The |product name| service enables developers to programmatically view and
configure their existing dedicated hardware load balancer resources such as
VIPs, nodes and health checks. The API does NOT allow programmers to provision
dedicated hardware load balancers.


This guide is intended to assist software developers who want to manage
dedicated hardware load balancer resources by using the REST application
programming interface (API) for the Rackspace |product name| service.

To use the information provided here, you should have a general understanding of
the service and have access to an installation of it. You should
also be familiar with the following technologies:

- RESTful web services
- HTTP/1.1
- JSON serialization formats
