Service updates
===============

Rackspace provides service updates to introduce backward-compatible updates
and modifications to |apiservice| |contract version|. These changes are not
intended to break any existing code that relies on the API (SDK, web
applications, scripts, and so on). However, you might want to update or extend
your code to use new features and enhancements.

To learn about updates and changes included in this and other releases, see the
:ref:`Release Notes <release-notes>`.
